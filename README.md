## unique dynamic wallpapers!

Lufram is my app that let's add customizable dynamic wallpapers to Android! It is inspired by macOS Mojave's dynamic
wallpaper feature - except that it is much more than that. Currently it (will) support the following features:

1. Slideshow of discrete wallpapers: Users can create albums of wallpapers that will periodically be shuffled
thorough. (Developed/Near Completion)

2. Transitional dynamic wallpapers based on daytime: This is like discrete wallpaper slideshows, except the
changing will be done in a smooth transition. This will actually leverage Android's dynamic wallpaper API.
(Not Developed)

3. Brightness-based transitions: Allow wallpapers to dim down in low-light conditions! (Not Developed)
